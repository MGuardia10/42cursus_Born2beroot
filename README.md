# 42Madrid - Born2beroot

The Born2beroot project is a server administration project where we create and configure a Virtual Machine (VM) using VirtualBox to host a web server. ItÂ´s a great opportunity to learn about server administration and gain hands-on experience with setting up and configuring a web server.

As a result, the implementation of certain parts may appear strange and for sure had room for improvement.
